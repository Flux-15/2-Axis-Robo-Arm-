# 2-Axis-Robo-Arm-
This project involves building a 2-axis robot arm with a gripper using Arduino, a joystick, and SG90 servo motors. The programming and circuit are complete, with the servos responding smoothly to the joystick. The final step is to build and assemble the physical model.  Feel free to check out the code or contribute!
