# 2-Axis Robot with Gripper
This project is a 2-axis robotic arm with a gripper, controlled by an Arduino and a joystick, using SG90 servo motors. The robot is designed to perform basic pick-and-place tasks with smooth and precise movements.
# Project Overview
Control: The robot is operated via a joystick, allowing for intuitive control of the two axes and the gripper. 

Hardware: The setup includes an Arduino, SG90 servos for each axis and the gripper, and a joystick for user input. 

Software: The Arduino code manages the servo motors based on joystick input, providing seamless control over the robot's movements.
# Status
Programming and Circuit: Completed. The servos are fully responsive to the joystick inputs, and the gripper mechanism functions as expected. 

Model: In progress. The final assembly, including building the physical structure and integrating all components, is the next step.
